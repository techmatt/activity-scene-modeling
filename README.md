# activity-scene-modeling
Activity-centric Scene Synthesis for Functional 3D Scene Modeling

The paper, database, and latest information for this project can be found here:
http://graphics.stanford.edu/projects/synthmodel/

 *** Note that porting this codebase to a github project is a work-in-progress,
 *** and the project is incomplete with necssary external dependencies not
 *** included and missing references to the underlying database stores needed
 *** by the synthesis pipeline. We are working to incorporate the dependencies
 *** and otherwise update the codebase so it can be used by others.
